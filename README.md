# Verified Functional Programming in Agda

This repository contains the Agda code I'm writing while working
through [_Verified Functional Programming in
Agda_](https://www.amazon.com/Verified-Functional-Programming-Agda-Books/dp/1970001240)
by Aaron Stump. I'm reading the book while participating in the [*SF
Types, Theorems, and Programming Languages*
meetup](https://www.meetup.com/SF-Types-Theorems-and-Programming-Languages/).
